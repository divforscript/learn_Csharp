// Challenge Project - Create a Mini Game

/*
- The code declares the following variables:
    - Variables to determine the size of the Terminal window.
    - Variables to track the locations of the player and food.
    - Arrays `states` and `foods` to provide available player and food appearances
    - Variables to track the current player and food appearance

- The code provides the following methods:
    - A method to determine if the Terminal window was resized.
    - A method to display a random food appearance at a random location.
    - A method that changes the player appearance to match the food consumed.
    - A method that temporarily freezes the player movement.
    - A method that moves the player according to directional input.
    - A method that sets up the initial game state.

- The code doesn't call the methods correctly to make the game playable. The following features are missing:
    - Code to determine if the player has consumed the food displayed.
    - Code to determine if the food consumed should freeze player movement.
    - Code to determine if the food consumed should increase player movement.
    - Code to increase movement speed.
    - Code to redisplay the food after it's consumed by the player.
    - Code to terminate execution if an unsupported key is entered.
    - Code to terminate execution if the terminal was resized.
*/

// Specifications

/*
Terminate on resize
This feature must:

- Determine if the terminal was resized before allowing the game to continue
- Clear the Console and end the game if the terminal was resized
- Display the following message before ending the program: Console was resize. Program exiting.
*/


/*
Add optional termination
- Modify the existing Move method to support an optional parameter
- If enabled, the optional parameter should detect nondirectional key input
- If nondirectional input is detected, allow the game to terminate
